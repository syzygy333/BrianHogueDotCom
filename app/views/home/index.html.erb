    <p class="content">Hello! My name is Brian, and I'm a junior Web developer specializing in Ruby/Rails, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
    <p class="content">A little background about me: I spent eight years working as a copy editor and paginator for a couple of daily newspapers. Given the state of the industry as a whole and the state of the particular newsrooms I worked in, I knew that making it a lifelong career would be difficult if not impossible.</p>
    <p class="content">So, having been interested in Web development for many years through being a Web consumer and through being exposed to it through my brother, I decided to attend Launch Academy.</p>
    <p class="content">I learned a great many things in my apprenticeship at Launch, the most important of which might be how to learn new things quickly.</p>
    <p class="content">There's a lot more to my story; if you want to hear more, please feel free to contact me through one of my accounts below.</p>
